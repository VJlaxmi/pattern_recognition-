# Video Script: AI Agent for Operational Excellence

## [Opening – 10 sec]

"Innovation begins with a simple shift—moving from awareness to foresight, from reacting to leading. Innovators' Arena 2026 asks us to imagine IDC's AI future. This project shows exactly what that future can look like.

Today, we're introducing the **AI Agent for Operational Excellence**—an intelligent system that transforms how we monitor, analyze, and optimize case management operations."

## [Problem – 20 sec]

"Today, operational oversight relies on manual reviews, fragmented data, and delayed signals. 

Analysts spend hours pulling data from multiple sources, creating reports that are outdated by the time they're shared. Trends slip by unnoticed. SLA risks surface only after breaches occur. Critical insights are discovered reactively—often when it's too late to prevent impact.

Leaders navigate decisions without real-time clarity, forced to rely on static dashboards and historical reports that don't reveal what's happening *now* or what's coming *next*."

## [Vision – 18 sec]

"Innovators' Arena challenges us to deliver **AI-Driven Efficiency**, **AI-Driven Quality**, and bold innovation. It calls for solutions that don't just automate tasks—but elevate how IDC operates, decides, and improves.

That vision inspired the creation of our **AI Agent for Operational Excellence**—a proactive intelligence system that continuously monitors, analyzes, and alerts. It doesn't just report what happened; it predicts what will happen and guides us to act before issues escalate."

## [Solution – 45 sec]

"The **AI Agent for Operational Excellence** is an autonomous intelligence layer that continuously analyzes KPIs, SLAs, case workflows, and operational patterns.

**Here's what it does:**

• **Real-Time KPI Monitoring**: Automatically calculates closure rates, SLA compliance, resolution times, and workload distribution across teams—all in seconds, not hours.

• **Proactive Risk Detection**: Identifies cases at risk of SLA breach *before* they breach, flags high-priority open cases, and surfaces aging cases that need immediate attention.

• **Pattern Recognition**: Discovers temporal patterns, recurring case types, and workload imbalances that human analysts might miss in fragmented data.

• **Intelligent Insights**: Uses Azure OpenAI to generate natural language summaries, risk assessments, and actionable recommendations—transforming data into strategic guidance.

• **Interactive Intelligence**: A conversational AI chat interface where leaders can ask questions like 'What are the top risks?' or 'Which team has bottlenecks?' and get precise, data-driven answers instantly.

This AI agent transforms scattered data into a unified, real-time stream of insights. It proactively alerts leaders and analysts to what matters, why it matters, and where action is needed—all through an intuitive web interface built with Streamlit."

## [Demonstration Highlights – 30 sec]

"Let me show you what this looks like in action:

**The system processes case data in seconds**, automatically:
- Calculating key performance indicators
- Detecting patterns and anomalies
- Identifying at-risk cases
- Generating AI-powered insights

**The interactive dashboard** provides:
- Executive summaries with key metrics
- Visual charts showing case distributions
- Risk tables highlighting urgent issues
- Pattern analysis revealing trends
- AI-generated recommendations

**The chat interface** enables natural language queries:
- Ask 'What are the top risks?' → Get precise counts and breakdowns
- Ask 'Why is closure rate low?' → Receive data-driven explanations
- Ask 'Which team needs help?' → See specific bottlenecks and recommendations

All of this happens in real-time, with data-driven precision and AI-enhanced intelligence."
